    "#### high factor exposure\n",
    "In factor investing, high factor exposure refers to the strong correlation between a portfolio or security and a specific factor. In simple terms, if a portfolio or security has high exposure to a factor, its performance (such as returns) is more likely to be influenced by that factor. This means that when the factor performs well, the portfolio or security is likely to perform well, and vice versa.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, let's consider the use of the market value factor (i.e., company market capitalization) in stock investing. If a portfolio has high exposure to the market value factor, its performance will be more susceptible to the influence of the market value factor. If the market value factor increases, the portfolio may perform well; conversely, if the market value factor decreases, the portfolio may underperform. Therefore, understanding the high factor exposure of a portfolio or security is crucial for investors as it helps them better comprehend the performance and risk characteristics of their investments."
